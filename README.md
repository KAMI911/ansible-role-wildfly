## Requirements

None.

## Installation

    ansible-galaxy install kami911.wildfly

## Role Variables
It's important to change the bind addresses to localhost or internal network in
production environments. The management user is also intended for
non-production environments, so you must change these variables for production
or undefine them and the user creation task will be skipped. You can also set
the variable `wildfly_management_user_overwrite` to `no` to avoid the user
creation or override and have the correct change status.

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    wildfly_force_update: false

Force update when same version is already installed. Old version is always updated.

    wildfly_service_status: 'restarted'

Specify the state of service. Possible values are: reloaded, restarted, started, stopped. Default is restarted. The started and stopped state are idempotent actions that will not run commands
unless necessary. The restarted state will always bounce the service and reloaded state will always reload.


    wildfly_system_integration: false

Put Wildfly configuration files into Unix filesystem standard location (true), or put files
 into Wildfly application folders and create symlinks to binaries (false). Default: false

    wildfly_system_dc_language: en_US

Export this language as LANG and LC_ALL shell variables for the domain contorller.

    wildfly_system_language: {{ wildfly_system_dc_language }}

Export this language as LANG and LC_ALL shell variables for the domain nodes.

    wildfly_version: 24.0.1.Final

    wildfly_file_version: '17.0'

Specify Wildfly config file version. 14 = '8.0'; 15-18 = '10.0'; 20 = '13.0'; 24 = 17.0.

### Standalone or Domain mode configuration

    wildfly_mode: domain

Select Wildfly configuration mode. Supported modes are standalone and domain

    wildfly_role: domain-master-slave  # supported roles: domain-master domain-master-slave domain-slave domain

In case of Wildfly domain mode, please select roles for the host. For domain mode you must have one non slave mode Wildfly host. Hence you must have at least one domain-master or domain-master-slave or domain mode host.
The difference between domain-master or domain-master-slave or domain mode are:
* domain-master: contains only domain controller. Uses one Wildfly instance.
* domain-master-slave: contains a domain controller and a separated domain slave. Uses two Wildfly instances in smart way.
* domain: contains a domain controller and an intagrated domain slave. Uses one Wildfly instance.

    wildfly_system_name: app-system

Specify the system wide name of this installation. This has same value accross multiple hosts of same domain.

    wildfly_instance_name: 'wildfly_{{ wildfly_system_name }}'

Instance name of standalone and domain slave mode Wildfly installation. For example the name of init.s and systemd scripts.

    wildfly_dc_instance_name: 'wildfly-dc_{{ wildfly_system_name }}'

Instance name of domain master mode Wildfly installation. For example the name of init.s and systemd scripts.

    wildfly_dc_backup_mode: false

Switch domain slaves to backup mode. Causes the slave host controller to create and maintain a local copy (domain.cached-remote.xml) of the domain configuration. If ignore-unused-configuration is unset in host.xml,a complete copy of the domain configuration will be stored locally, otherwise the configured value of ignore-unused-configuration in host.xml will be used.

    wildfly_dc_cached_mode: false

Switch domain slaves to cached domain controller mode. If the slave host controller is unable to contact the master domain controller to get its configuration at boot, this option will allow the slave host controller to boot and becomeoperational using a previously cached copy of the domain configuration (domain.cached-remote.xml.) If the cached configuration is not present, this boot will fail. This file is created using using one ofthe following methods:
* A previously successful connection to the master domain controller using --backup or --cached-dc.
* Copying the domain configuration from an alternative host to domain/configuration/domain.cached-remote.xml.
The unavailable master domain controller will be polled periodically for availability, and once becoming available, the slave host controller will reconnect to the master host controller and synchronize the domainconfiguration. During the interval the master domain controller is unavailable, the slave host controller will not be able make any modifications to the domain configuration, but it may launch servers and handlerequests to deployed applications etc.

#### Additional Java parameters

[Check Java parameters by versions.](https://chriswhocodes.com/vm-options-explorer.html)

### Process limits configuration

    wildfly_limits_file: '/etc/security/limits.d/{{ wildfly_user }}'

Name and location of limits file to control system resource allocations.

    wildfly_limits_conf:
     - domain: '{{ wildfly_user }}'
       type: soft
       item: nofile
       value: 14000
       # Note: systemd service file will use this value to set LimitNOFILE
       # value for node, domain controller is fixed to 2048.
     - domain: '{{ wildfly_user }}'
       type: hard
       item: nofile
       value: 16384
     - domain: '{{ wildfly_user }}'
       type: soft
       item: nproc
       value: 7000
     - domain: '{{ wildfly_user }}'
       type: hard
       item: nproc
       value: 8192

Set limits for specified user (domain). Value is the limit.
Note: systemd service file will use this value to set LimitNOFILE
value for node, domain controller is fixed to 2048.

### Wildfly log compression options

    wildfly_log_rotate_minsize: 20K

Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes, but not before the additionally
specified time interval (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). The related size option is
 similar except that it is mutually exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes
log files to be rotated without regard for the last rotation time. When minsize is used,
both the size and timestamp of a log file are considered.

    wildfly_log_compress_command: '/usr/bin/xz'

Location is the compressor program. Default is xz so the dafault value is '/usr/bin/xz'.
You can also use for example: '/usr/bin/gzip'.

    wildfly_log_compress_options: '-9e'

Options for compression program. For xz the default is '-9e' that means maximum compression.
For gzip íou can use for example: '-9'.

    wildfly_log_compress_extension: '.xz'

File extension for logrotate specification. xz is '.xz', and gzip is 'gz'.

### Using as a submudule of an AWX playbook

#### Add as a submodule

```
git submodule add --force git@github.com:KAMI911/ansible-role-wildfly.git roles/wildfly
```

#### Update as sumodule

Update only this submodule

```
git submodule update --remote roles/wildfly/
```

Update all submodules:

```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

## Admin User

It's recommended that you create Wildfly's admin user separately as follows:

    $ ansible-playbook main.yml --extra-vars "wildfly_management_user=admin wildfly_management_password=admin"

## SSL Support

In order to enable SSL for applications and the management interface you have
to set the `wildfly_enable_ssl` variable to `yes` and put the keystore file
into this role files folder.

You can create a self signed keystore file with the following command:

    $ keytool -genkey -alias mycert -keyalg RSA -sigalg MD5withRSA -keystore my.jks -storepass secret  -keypass secret -validity 9999

It's recommended that the first and last name is your hostname. After this file
is created, you have to set the keystore related variable in order to work
correctly.

To create a keystore with your own certificate you need to run the following commands:

    $ cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt intermediate.crt > allcacerts.crt
    $ openssl verify -CAfile allcacerts.crt certificate.crt
    $ openssl pkcs12 -export -chain -CAfile allcacerts.crt -in certificate.crt -inkey private.key -out my.p12 -name my
    $ keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore my.jks -srckeystore my.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -alias my

The first command will add your intermediate to the openssl's CAs; the order is
important and you may need to put the itermediate file before `ca-bundle.crt`.
The second command is to verify that your certificate is signed by a known CA,
usually if this step fails, the rest of the process will fail too.
The third command is to import the all our certificate files in pkcs12 format.
Finally we use keytool to create the keystore to be used in wildfly.

## Troubleshooting

  - If you're getting a `Connection refused` error in your browser check that
  you have the correct IP address in your `wildfly_bind_address` variable.
